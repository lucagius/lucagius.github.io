title: "Commercializing Contrarian Ideas: Evidence from AI Contests <br> <br> <span style='font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;'>Job Market Paper</span>"
collection: "publications"
excerpt: "This work builds on the notion that some ideas are not only distinctive, but also contrarian: pursued by few, and met with open skepticism by most. Such skepticism hinders contrarians from attracting resources but allows them to experiment openly without fear of immediate imitation. To investigate this dynamic, I leverage hundreds of Artificial Intelligence contests where researchers either employ popular, state-of-the-art methods or pursue alternative, contrarian approaches. These contests act as sudden “moments of clarity” that reveal which methods perform best. They allow researchers to attract resources for commercialization, but also potentially alert competitors of the opportunity. Through a difference-in-differences design, I find that when contrarian contestants win, they are up to 7× more likely to found startups, and their startups attract up to 3× higher venture capital valuations. This cannot be simply explained by the fact that contrarians are more likely to achieve breakthroughs; much of the advantage arises by winning close races. Instead, while close victories validate contrarian entrepreneurs and allow them to attract resources, mainstream researchers tend to adopt contrarian methods only when they conclusively outperform traditional approaches. This reluctance to build on contrarian ideas allows contrarians to leverage public demonstrations to attract resources without provoking immediate competition."
