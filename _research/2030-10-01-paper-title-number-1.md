title: "Commercializing Contrarian Ideas: Evidence from AI Contests <br> <br> <span style='font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;'>Job Market Paper</span>"
collection: "publications"
excerpt: "Entrepreneurs with contrarian approaches  -- even when they turn out to be right -- often struggle to attract resources for commercialization. Challenging the conventional viewpoint carries a higher burden of proof: contrarians need to show not only that their proposition is valuable, but also that their approach is superior to mainstream alternatives. Therefore, public demonstrations that directly compare their strategy to traditional ones can help contrarians to convince skeptics and achieve commercial success. I analyze data from hundreds of academic contests held between 1997 and 2022 that pitted different methods against each other, to help clarify the most effective approaches. I find that (i) winners of these contests are significantly more likely to found a startup soon after their victory than runners-up; (ii) winning has a certification effect that persists even when winners and runners-up are close; and (iii) this effect is 7x stronger for the contrarian winners, defined as those using families of algorithms that lagged behind the state-of-the-art prior to the contest. Contrary to the notion that public disclosure hurts value capture, the contrarian winners have 3.3x higher valuations than mainstream winners and 20x higher value than the average AI startup."
