excerpt: "We present a new, stylized fact: female inventors are more likely to be collocated with 
their co-inventors compared to men. We interpret this correlation as suggestive evidence that women inventors face higher 
geographical frictions, potentially due to family obligations. This is a concerning possibility, given that 50% of all team patents in 2020 was
produced by multi-located teams, and is particularly relevant for the work-from-anywhere debate.
In support of our interpretation, we find that the collocation gender gap exists for both new and 
experienced inventors. The collocation gap increases with age: women are less collocated than men 
when they are statistically less likely to have children (under 32), but become more collocated
past this threshold. Men, instead, become consistently less collocated as they age.
Preliminary evidence suggests that women who worked on multi-location patents early 
in their careers stop patenting earlier. To conclude, the gap (and the gendered geographical frictions it might represent) is mitigated in top technology clusters
where teams are typically more collocated."
