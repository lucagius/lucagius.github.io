title: "Disagreeing about startup ideas: Evidence from venture competitions <br> <br> R&R, Strategy Science"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/disagreement-startups
excerpt: 'The theory-based view of the firm emphasizes that entrepreneurs have polarizing beliefs – some
stakeholders might share them and others reject them. The nature and extent of this disagreement
influences a startup’s strategy and its path to success. This paper suggests a new measure of the
divergence of opinions around a startup idea that I use to test this theoretical framework. Leveraging data
from venture competitions, where different judges grade the same startup, I use the dispersion in their
scores to build a measure of disagreement about a startup’s value proposition. I find that disagreement in
scores is large and persistent. It reflects both differences in information (that is, disagreement that
diminishes in later competition rounds) and “agreement to disagree” between judges with different
viewpoints (for example, former entrepreneurs vs. venture capitalists). Such disagreement is
disproportionately high (i) in R&D-intensive sectors, (ii) for startups with a granted patent, and (iii)
around a startup’s strategy (as opposed to the quality of its team or product). I conclude that polarization
is associated with some measures of future success – e.g., the amount of funding eventually raised and
future sales. Despite this, polarizing businesses are not more likely to be acquired. Finally, I discuss the implications of this evidence for entrepreneurial strategy.'
