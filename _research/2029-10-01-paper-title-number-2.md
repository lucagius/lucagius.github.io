title: "Disagreement Predicts Startup Success: Evidence from Venture Competitions <br> <br> <span style='font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;'>Minor Revision requested, Strategy Science</span>"

permalink: /publication/disagreement-startups
excerpt: 'I present a new, compelling finding: the more venture competition judges disagree about the quality of a startup, the more likely the startup is to succeed. To explain why, I build on the notion that (i)
entrepreneurs pursue opportunities based on their subjective beliefs (ii) common opinion cannot be a
source of competitive advantage. Therefore, value is disproportionately created and captured by founders
with atypical ideas that spark disagreement, and potential investors should harness disagreement as a
predictor of success. I leverage data from 67 venture competitions to show that the empirical implications
of this theoretical framework are supported by the data, whereas alternative explanations (e.g., that judges
disagree more about risky ventures) are not. Additionally, I provide insights into what evaluators tend to
disagree more often (e.g., former entrepreneurs) and which aspects of a startup (e.g., business model) are
most polarizing. This work has broad implications for investors and institutions that strive to evaluate the
potential of startup ideas.'
