title: "Disagreement Predicts Startup Success: Evidence from Venture Competitions <br> <br> <span style='font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;'>Accepted, Strategy Science</span>"

excerpt: 'This paper examines the relationship between disagreement surrounding a startup proposition and its
future success. I find that the more venture competition judges disagree on the quality of a startup, the
more likely the startup is to succeed, particularly when its proposition is unique. To explain this
correlation, I build on the notion that (i) entrepreneurs pursue opportunities based on their subjective
beliefs (ii) common opinion alone cannot be a source of competitive advantage. Therefore, value is
disproportionately created and captured by founders with unconventional ideas that spark disagreement,
and potential investors should harness disagreement as a predictor of success. I leverage data from 67
venture competitions to show that the empirical implications of this theoretical framework are supported
by the data, whereas alternative explanations (e.g., that judges disagree more about risky ventures) are
not. Additionally, I provide insights into what evaluators tend to disagree more often (e.g., former
entrepreneurs) and which aspects of a startup (e.g., business model) are most polarizing. This work has
broad implications for investors and institutions that strive to evaluate the potential of startup ideas.'
