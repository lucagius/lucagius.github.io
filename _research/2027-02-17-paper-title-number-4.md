title: "Do NDAs help to sell ideas? Evidence from 900 confidential agreements"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: "Common wisdom suggests that confidentiality agreements can help sellers to safely disclose their ideas to potential buyers. However, buyers could potentially refuse to sign a binding agreement prior to disclosure and be even more likely to walk away from the transaction. I test the role of confidentiality agreements in facilitating idea transactions using data from an online marketplace of digital startups. I find that confidentiality agreements allow sellers to share more information: sellers who require NDAs from potential bidders are 24% more likely to share their profit and loss statement relatively to sellers who don't. However, NDAs discourage bidder participation: requiring confidentiality agreements is associated with 29% fewer bids, making it 6% less likely that the venture will be sold. Overall, the results cast doubt on the effectiveness of NDAs in fostering idea markets."
