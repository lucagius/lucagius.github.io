Welcome! I am an incoming Assistant Professor at Bocconi University’s Management and Technology Department. My research focuses on innovation and entrepreneurial strategy, with a special interest in the commercialization of unconventional ideas and technologies.

I received my PhD from [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/ties/about-us).
